Summary Report on QS World University Rankings Data Analysis

Introduction
The project focuses on analyzing the 2023 QS World University Rankings dataset. The dataset contains information on universities globally,
including their ranks and scores in various metrics such as Academic Reputation (AR), Employer Reputation (ER), and Faculty-Student Ratio (FSR).
The goal is to explore trends, identify top-performing institutions, and compare rankings based on key metrics.

Objectives
•	To identify top universities based on their ranks.
•	To analyze key metrics contributing to university rankings.
•	To compare top 100 universities with those ranked between 101 and 500.
•	To explore the distribution of rankings and country representation.

Data Exploration
Top 10 Universities
A bar chart was plotted to show the top 10 universities based on their rankings. This visual helps in quickly identifying the best-performing institutions.

Ranking Distribution
The distribution of rankings was visualized using a histogram. Most universities are concentrated in certain rank ranges, giving insight into the overall spread of the rankings.

University Count by Ranking Ranges
•	Top 100 universities: There are X universities in the top 100.
•	Rank 101-500: There are Y universities ranked between 101 and 500.
•	Rank 501-1000: There are Z universities ranked between 501 and 1000.

Top Countries Representation
The analysis showed how many universities each country had in the top 100. This was visualized in a pie chart, indicating which countries dominate the top ranks in higher education.

Key Metric Analysis
Top 100 vs. Rank 101-500 Comparison
A comparison of key metrics—Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, and Faculty-Student Ratio—was conducted between universities ranked in the top 100 and those ranked between 101 and 500.
•	Academic Reputation (AR): Universities in the top 100 generally have higher AR scores, reflecting their global academic influence.
•	Employer Reputation (ER): Top 100 universities also tend to score better in terms of ER, highlighting their graduates' employability.
•	Faculty-Student Ratio (FSR): The comparison shows some variation, but top universities often maintain favorable FSRs, contributing to higher rankings.

The differences between the top 100 and universities ranked 101-500 were illustrated in a bar chart.
Conclusion
•	Dominance of Countries: A small number of countries, such as the US and UK, have a significant representation in the top 100, reflecting their global dominance in higher education.
•	Top 100 Performance: Universities in the top 100 consistently outperform those ranked between 101-500 in key metrics such as Academic Reputation and Employer Reputation.
•	Importance of Key Metrics: Academic Reputation and Employer Reputation are the strongest indicators of higher rankings, while Faculty-Student Ratio shows some variation across rank ranges.
